## Fatal Automobile Accidents in the GTA

Given this data, we ask a few questions, which will be addressed below.

### What time is it most unsafe to drive?

First, let's import our libraries and our dataset.
```markdown

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

data <- read.csv("Fatal_Collisions.csv")

```
Now, let's look at the data

``` markdown
data %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  summarize (n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(YEAR))
```

From here, we we get a tibble shown below:


``` markdown
# A tibble: 11 x 2
    YEAR     n
   <int> <int>
 1  2018    66
 2  2017    63
 3  2016    78
 4  2015    65
 5  2014    51
 6  2013    63
 7  2012    44
 8  2011    35
 9  2010    43
10  2009    48
11  2008    54
```

The data seems pretty evenly dispersed across all years. What about other variables?

``` markdown
  
data %>%
  group_by(LIGHT) %>%
  summarize (n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
 
 ```
 
 ``` markdown
 
 # A tibble: 8 x 2
  LIGHT                    n
  <fct>                <int>
1 Daylight               317
2 Dark                   140
3 Dark, artificial       123
4 Dawn, artificial         7
5 Dusk                     7
6 Dusk, artificial         7
7 Daylight, artificial     5
8 Dawn                     4
 
```

We see that accidents usually happen during daylight or dark, but never in between. What about hour?

 ``` markdown
hours <- data %>%
  group_by(Hour) %>%
  summarize (n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
  
ggplot(aes(x=Hour, y=n), data =hours) + 
  geom_line(size=1) + 
  ggtitle('Fatal Accidents by Hour in Toronto from 2008-2018') +
  ylab('Number') +
  xlab('Hour')

```

``` markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
